Build a Secure CRUD API with Role-Based Access Control
Objective:
Develop a comprehensive REST API to manage event data using MongoDB. Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations along with user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only admins can update or delete event data.
Technologies:
Node.js & Express.js: For building the server-side application and handling API requests.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to simplify interaction with MongoDB.
JWT (JSON Web Token): To securely store and transmit user authentication information.
Bcrypt: For secure password hashing.
(Optional) Passport.js: An authentication middleware library for Node.js.
Requirements:
1. User Authentication:
Users should be able to register and log in.
Securely store login credentials (username/email and password) using hashing.
Use JWT to authenticate subsequent API requests after successful login.
2. Role-Based Authorization:
Implement user roles (e.g., admin, user).
Only admins should be authorized to update or delete event data.
Integrate authorization checks with relevant API endpoints.
3. CRUD Operations:
Users should be able to create new events.
Users should be able to retrieve all events or a specific event by ID.
Admins should be able to update existing event data.
Admins should be able to delete events.
4. Data Storage:
Use MongoDB to store event data.
Define a Mongoose schema for the event data structure.
5. API Endpoints:
Design RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on event data.
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for specific endpoints.
6. Error Handling:
Implement proper error handling for invalid requests, unauthorized access attempts, and database operations.
Bonus:
Implement unit tests for your API endpoints to ensure functionality.
Add documentation for your API using tools like Swagger.
Steps to Complete the Challenge:
Setup and Configuration:
Set up a Node.js project with Express.js.
Configure MongoDB and Mongoose.
Set up environment variables for configuration (e.g., database URI, JWT secret).
User Authentication:
Create registration and login endpoints.
Hash passwords using Bcrypt before storing them in the database.
Generate JWT tokens on successful login.
Role-Based Access Control:
Define user roles and store them in the user schema.
Implement middleware to check user roles for protected routes.
CRUD Operations:
Create endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting events.
Ensure only authorized users (admins) can update and delete events.
Data Modeling:
Define a Mongoose schema for the event data.
API Endpoints:
Create and test endpoints for:
Creating new events (POST /events)
Retrieving all events (GET /events)
Retrieving a specific event by ID (GET /events/:id)
Updating event data (PUT /events/:id)
Deleting events (DELETE /events/:id)
Error Handling:
Implement error handling middleware to manage different types of errors.
Bonus Tasks:
Write unit tests for your endpoints.
Document your API using Swagger or similar tools.
By completing this challenge, you'll gain practical experience in building secure and robust REST APIs with user authentication, authorization, and CRUD functionalities.
